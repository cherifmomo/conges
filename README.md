Angular 13 - Mongodb - Express Js - Material

Leave management (Angular) with its own API (express Js - MongoDB)

MongoDB 2 collections {employees - categories)

Angular:
    - (Add/Edit/Delete/ sort) employee - Leave
    - (Add/Edit/Delete/ sort) Categories

Express Js with a connection to the database {employees)
http://localhost:3000//api/employees {getAll - create - update - delete - deleteAll}
http://localhost:3000//api/categories {getAll - create - update - delete - deleteAll}


The problem solving cors : 
    - The file - proxy.conf.json in Angular
    - Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in Express Js
